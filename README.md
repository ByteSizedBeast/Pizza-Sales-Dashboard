🍕 Pizza Sales Report - Power BI Dashboard
📌 Project Overview

This project is an interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze Pizza Sales Data.
The dashboard provides insights into sales performance, customer buying trends, and best/worst selling pizzas.

I used Microsoft SQL Server to store and query the raw data, then connected it with Power BI.
Data cleaning and transformations were performed in Power Query before visualization.
